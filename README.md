## Brief Description:
  Welcome to the classic game of UNO! UNO is an american card game of 2-5 players where your objective is to discard all your cards and be the first to reach 500 points. Each player starts the game with 7 cards, which may include normal number cards or special action cards, such as reverse, skip, and wild cards. At every turn, you will be given the option to draw, play, or call UNO. To play a card, the card must match the last played card in either color or number, or both. If no card can be played, you must draw a card. Once you have one card, you should call out UNO during your turn. If you fail to call UNO or if you call UNO at a wrong time, you will have to draw 2 more cards. Once a player wins, the remaining cards from each player's hands are added up, which goes towards the winner's score. The first person to reach 500 points wins! Follow the instructions, and have fun! :)
