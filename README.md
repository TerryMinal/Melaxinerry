## Brief Description:
  Welcome to the classic game of UNO! UNO is an american card game of 2-5 players where your objective is to discard all your cards and be the first to reach 500 points. Each player starts the game with 7 cards, which may include a mix of normal number cards or special action cards, such as reverse, skip, and wild cards. At every turn, you have the option to draw, play, or call UNO. To play a card, the card must match the last played card in either color or number, or both. If no card can be played, you must draw a card.
